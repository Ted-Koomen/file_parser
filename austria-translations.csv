,Question/Answer 1,"What is ofo? 
",,Was ist ofo?
,,"ofo is the world’s first and largest station-free bike sharing platform. We provide convenient and affordable urban travel – reducing carbon emissions, easing traffic congestion, saving energy, and promoting better living along the way.
",,"ofo ist die weltweit erste und größte stationsfreie Bikesharing Plattform. Wir bieten bequeme und leistbare Fortbewegung im urbanen Raum - dabei werden Emissionen reduziert, Straßenverkehr entlastet, Energie gespart und ganz nebenbei ein besser Lifestyle gefördert!"
,Question/Answer 2,"How did ofo start? 
",,Wie hat ofo begonnen?
,,"ofo began in 2014 when CEO David Dai and his co-founding partners saw an opportunity to leverage smart technology to improve cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation. As students at Peking University, David and his partners convinced about 2,000 students to add their bicycles to a private registry. The registry could be accessed through a mobile app and allowed participants to use any registered bike, anywhere, at any time.
                                                                                                                                             The platform became so popular that it expanded to five more campuses within just three months. Building upon this momentum, the company revamped its operating model to offer users standardized bicycles and began expanding to major cities across China and internationally. Today the service is open to anyone in over 180 major cities with a smartphone.
",,"ofo wurde 2014 von Studenten in China gegründet und bietet ein intelligentes und flexibles Transportsystem für Städte. Die Gründer haben sich zum Ziel gesetzt, umweltschonenden Verkehr zu fördern und das Fahrrad zum bevorzugten Transportmittel im Stadtverkehr zu machen. Dabei sieht sich ofo als Erweiterung zu bestehenden Leihradsystemen und möchte mittels moderner und unkomplizierter Bedienung neue Zielgruppen ansprechen. Das Service funktioniert stationsfrei via App und einem von ofo weiterentwickelten smarten Schloss. Damit können Radfahrer rasch und mühelos verfügbare Fahrräder finden, mieten und überall dort, wo es gesetzlich erlaubt ist, abstellen"

",,Hat ofo wirklich einen positiven Effekt auf die Reduktion der Verkehrsbelastung?

",,"Im Durchschnitt legen unsere User über 6,4 Millionen Kilometer zurück und das in über 180 Städten weltweit.
